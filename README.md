# cryptocurrency_clustering
## Overview
Accountability Accounting is a leading investment bank. They are interested in introducing a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to their clients. They have requested a report that includes information about the cryptocurrencies currently on the market and how they can be classified into different groups. The dataset retrieved for this report is not well organized and has many missing values.

Using Jupyter notebook along with Pandas, we have used the "select-process-transform" to organize the data to fit into an unsupervised machine learning model.

## Results
We used the K-means clustering method to classify 4 different types of crypto coins and scaled the data to visualize the classifications in a scatter plot.
